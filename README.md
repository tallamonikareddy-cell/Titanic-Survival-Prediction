# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
Predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models for accurate predictions.

## Skills & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Project Steps
1. Load and explore the Titanic dataset.
2. Clean the data and handle missing values.
3. Perform feature engineering to improve model performance.
4. Train and evaluate machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
5. Visualize insights and model results.

## Outcome
- Built predictive models to identify passengers likely to survive.
- Extracted insights on key factors affecting survival, including age, passenger class, and gender.
